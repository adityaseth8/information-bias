# Multi-Attribute Sequential Search Game - UCD EconLab

## Project Description
This project is a Multi-Attribute Sequential Search Game where participants make choices between ordered pairs of money and tasks within a time limit. Participants have an endowment of money that they can spend to search for additional pairs. The game records the choice history, including timestamps and rounds. Finally, the game selects an ordered pair with decreasing probability, and participants must complete the corresponding number of tasks.
